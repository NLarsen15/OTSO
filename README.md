# OTSO
Oulu - Open-source geomagneToSphere prOpagation tool

OTSO is a geophysics tool used to compute the trajectories of cosmic rays within the Earth's magnetosphere. 
These computations are used to determine physical values, such as cut-off rigidities and asymptotic cones for locations on the Earth, 
that are needed by the cosmic ray research community.
OTSO provides the user with free reign to select from a plethera of input parameters for tests, such as geomagetospheric conditions, 
as well as offering various magnetospheric models to choose from. 

OTSO is open-source. Therefore, additions and suggestions from the community are welcome. 

Instructions for how to install and use OTSO are located within the OTSO user manual.
Note the instructions only apply to computers using the Windows operating system, installation steps for other operating systems will vary.
Steps to install OTSO on different systems will be included within the manual in the future once succesfully implemented on different systems.

This is a base release for the tool and bugs are to be expected. I ask the community to please inform me of any bugs they may encounter or provide solutions that can be added to the base code of OTSO.
